As of right now, i am thinking of setting up a script to handle the sending and receiving of things from the message queue, and another to deal with executing commands and handling the logic.

transeiver.py will be the transmission controller, handling input and output from files, packetizing/unpacketizing and input and output from the message queue's.

uav_controller.py will handle the execution of commands, and all of the logic therein lies.

overview.py will act as the main deamon that will watch the other processes.  there will be a flag file called ovw_flag that will be created and killed with the overview.py process
and will be monitored by the uav_controller.  if this flag is gone, but the uav_controller is still running, it will kill the other processes associated with the uav, restart the overview.py
process, and finally kill itself.
