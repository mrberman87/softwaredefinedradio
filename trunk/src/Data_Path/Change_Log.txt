Change from version 1.0 to 1.01 txrx_controller.py
1. Added Error event logic in the event one of the scripts fail and an error must be sent.
	a. For outside transmitter, added in option to receive 'Error' so the transmitter can send a frame event Error down
	b. make_pkts now has a single default variable that receives an input for the error frame
	c. Added receive Error event logic. If at any time a frame received has the event Error, return 'Error' to controller
2. Added cleanup statements to ensure the complete frame elif statement doesn't enter that logic state from any previous frame
	in error.
3. Changed where self.pkts was being cleared, as this could adversely effect the handshaking.
