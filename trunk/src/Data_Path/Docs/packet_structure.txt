This file is to help explain the fields and packet structure
used in the UAV project.

First, the structure in sudo code is:

	Field 1	       Field 2	  Field 3	Field 4		      Field 5		  Field 6
[USRP Sample padding][preamble][access code][packet header][whitened crc32 added payload][EoP byte]

Each of the fields is sent to the Modulator in a packed binary format: '\x55'
which represents '01010101' in binary.

The lengths of each of the fields are:

Field 1 Field 2 Field 3 Field 4 Field 5   Field 6
[  x  ] [  3  ] [  8  ] [  4  ] [Max 146] [  1  ]

	The total length of a packet without USB padding is: 162 bytes = 1296 bits

where x is the byte padding based on the length of the packet at generation. 

USRP Sample padding:

	The byte padding takes the packet to a length which is modulo 128 samples and 
	modulo 512 bytes for the USRP USB.

	modulus = 128
	byte_modulus = least_common_multiple(modulus/8, samples_per_symbol) * bits_per_symbol / samples_per_symbol
	r = packet_byte_length % byte_modulus
	if r == 0:
		return r
	return byte_modulus - r

	For the purpose of DBPSK (maximum length calculation):
	modulus = 128
	packet_byte_length = 162
	samples_per_symbol = 8
	bits_per_symbol = 1
	least_common_multiple(16, 8) = 16
	byte_modulus = 16 * 1 / 8 = 2
	r = 162 % 2 = 0
	Add zero extra padding at maximum packet length, therfore maximum packet length of any packet is 162 bytes.

DBPSK Preamble:

	3 bytes of '\x55' which equates to '0101' in bits

Access Code:

	\xAC\xDD\xA4\xE2\xF2\x8C\x20\xFC
	8 hexidecimal bytes with no idea as to why they were chosen.
