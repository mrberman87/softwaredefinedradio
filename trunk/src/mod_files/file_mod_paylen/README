Each system must change the paths to the correct files. Right now they are set my machine. Each user must change the login path and play with the payload length to test this out and get the desired results. This is just a work in progress on the ideas forumlated earlier. This file will take any file and pad it to the given payload length set inside the file. A new fix will be to call this method and reset the parameters that are currently running so as to make this padded file the new file to be transmitted. Can possibly do this in the init method of the transmit script. Further implementation is required.
