README for UAV_fft2.m

General Purpose:

This m file is used in octave for our purposes to take complex data represented using a binary alphabet 
and convert it into useable data for Octave to perform the FFT command and plot. Once the plot is formed,
the file then creates a JPEG image ofthe plot. Currently the image is being sent to the users Desktop
and being labeled FFT_image.jpeg

General Usage:

Under the octave command line:
This m file requires 3 inputs. I left them this way so they can still be configured easily later if we
choose to change the amount of points for the FFT or the file name of the source data.

UAV_fft2('filename', FFT Size 2^n ,Sampling Frequency into File)

1. The Filename will need to contain the full path if not in the same folder as the m file.
2. The FFT size will be 1024 for our purposes.
3. The sampling frequency is the 256e3 which is the base sample rate coming out of the USRP at a decimation
	rate of 250.
