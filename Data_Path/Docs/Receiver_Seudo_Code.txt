Suedo Code Receiver:

Step 1: Check the queue for crc passed payloads
Step 2: If there are payloads in the queue, retrieve them and start slicing process
Step 3: Slice total packet count, individual packet number, and original payload
Step 4: Determine if there was any lost packets between this packet and the last one
Step 5: Add this payload to the list of received payloads in the correct index location, padding the list object with empty
	strings to denote packets that were lost entirely during transmission or crc unaccaptable payloads.
Step 6: Continue queue checking, slicing, and list adding until the number of payloads present is equal to the total number
	of packets in the frame. This doesn't mean that all packets were received correctly, just that the last packet of
	the frame was received correctly and caused the length of the temporary payload holder to become the correct 
	length.
Step 7: Determine the index values of all lost packets if any denoted by empty strings in the list
Step 8: Respond to transmission source with frame packet and response on state of original transmission reception
	
	+ If sent response was Transmission Complete return data to overall controller
	+ If sent response was Incomplete Transmission:
		~ sent response 2nd packet contained indexes of missing payloads
		~ return to receive mode and wait for packets
		~ once receiving packets begins, slice different data sections apart
		~ insert newest round of packets to original list at packet number index locations without adding
			empty strings to denote missing packets between packet numbers
		~ recheck original list of received payloads for any missing payloads
		~ if all payloads accounted for, respond with Transmission Complete
		~ else, repeat Incomplete Transmission process until all original payloads accounted for
	+ If sent response was Event Unknown:
		~ sent response 2nd packet contained indexes of missing payloads, indexes include frame packet
		~ return to receive mode
		~ Transmitter on other side must resend the same event index as before but not in the first packet.
			The first packet will contain Packet Resend, but the individual packet numbers of this
			transmission will contain the original packet numbers.
