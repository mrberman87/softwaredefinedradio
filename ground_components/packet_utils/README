tester.py is currently for the packetizer.py and tx_rx_path.py

What I am doing with this is testing the packet structuring routines and making sure that what I put in gets pulled back out. Also we are going to utilize a packet decoder in the flow graph and not make our own.

The only packet handling we will be doing in python is the transmit path packets. Otherwise the base gnuradio will take care of it for us.

I have been using ps.txt as my source file.
