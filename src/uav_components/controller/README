As of right now, i am thinking of setting up a script to handle the sending and receiving of things from the message queue, and another to deal with executing commands and handling the logic.

transeiver.py will be the transmission controller, handling input and output from files, packetizing/unpacketizing and input and output from the message queue's.

uav_controller.py will handle the execution of commands, and all of the logic therein lies.
