#1.04 to 1.05 txrx_controller.py
1. Added updated documentation into txrx_doc.py
2. Updated txrx_controller.py with collated information from lab testing.
3. Version is ready for system integration testing.

#1.03 to 1.04 txrx_controller.py
1. Too much has changed to record. A lot of handshaking has been redone.
	The way the handshaking takes place is similar to before, but
	a lot of the hard coding for the long payload length had to be
	generalized to a smaller payload length due to packet length
	considerations. Also, the controller no longer saves the initial
	packets that were sent in the first transmission, the reason for
	this is because the payload is set and the original transmission
	will always have a different total number of packets than the
	new frame packet resend which will be smaller. For this reason, 
	payloads are stored and not packets. 
#1.02 to 1.03 txrx_controller.py
1. Fixed event_list[#] to self.event_list[#] in receive method.
2. Added Queue padding for the transmit_pkts() method because the last packets were not being sent.
3. Changed logic on if statement for total number of packets in make_pkts() to account for a length of 
	data exactly equal to a multiple of the payload length.
4. Changed logic when received 2nd frame or later and event is unknown.
5. Added comments in receive() to help with debugging of handshaking.
6. Added comments throughout controller to denote what has, and hasn't been tested with the USRP.

#1.01 to 1.02 txrx_controller.py
1. Changed all data/complete transmission returns that would hold up overall controller to print statements for
	using pipes instead of blocking returns.

#1.0 to 1.01 txrx_controller.py
1. Added Error event logic in the event one of the scripts fail and an error must be sent.
	a. For outside transmitter, added in option to receive 'Error' so the transmitter can send a frame event Error down
	b. make_pkts now has a single default variable that receives an input for the error frame
	c. Added receive Error event logic. If at any time a frame received has the event Error, return 'Error' to controller
2. Added cleanup statements to ensure the complete frame elif statement doesn't enter that logic state from any previous frame
	in error.
3. Changed where self.pkts was being cleared, as this could adversely effect the handshaking.
