Suedo Code Transmitter:

Step 1: Packetize all of the given data, including frame packet
Step 2: Transmit data over the USRP

	Step 1:
		Packet Structure:
		******************************************************************************************
		* Padding for USRP USB | Syncer | Preamble | Access Code | Payload with crc32 | Stop bit *
		******************************************************************************************

		Frame Packet:
		['Total number of packets in frame':'Packet number':'Frame event']
		
		Example:	'123:0:N'

			+ All packets hold a 'total number of packets number for the case of lost packets
			+ Packet number for the frame packet is always 0
			+ Frame events are always 2 characters long
			+ The frame events always have different characters for ease of determination
			+ Frame Event:
				- New Transmission:		'N'
				- Incomplete Transmission:	'I'
				- Packet Resend:		'P'
				- Transmission Complete:	'C'
				- Error Event:			'E'
				- Keep Alive:			'K'

					~ New Transmission: First attempt at sending frame
					~ Packet Resend: Received list of lost packets, sending lost packets 
						from initial frame
					~ Incomplete Transmission: Transmitter of incomplete transmission, must
						resend lost packets
					~ Transmission Complete: All packets from New Transmission are 
						accounted for
					~ Error Event: Something happend to software, letting other side know
						an error occured
					~ Keep Alive: To keep current settings alive and maintain link integrity
